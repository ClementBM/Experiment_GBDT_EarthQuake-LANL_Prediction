# Experiment with Gradient Boostring Decision Tree applied on EarthQuake predictions
First benchmark attempt to predict time to failure from audio signal recorded in a laboratory experiment.

Intro from Kaggle: "[..] predict the time remaining before laboratory earthquakes occur from real-time seismic data."
